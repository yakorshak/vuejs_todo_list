      I believe that my strength is my devotion to the job I do. In my
      professional experience, I have seen many talented engineers but they did
      not want to do the work that was over their zone of responsibility. And
      sometimes it caused to a huge amount of unresolved problems with a big
      impact on the business. So in my job, I try to devote myself and make
      everything that I can to gain common success for the company. Because
      success is a million right and in-time steps.

      This project is a part of preparation to an interview. I have just 3 days
      to dive into Vue.js, I hope it could show my serious attitude to the job
      and desire to be a part of a team.
